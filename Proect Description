🏆 ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED
1. Yen (1971)

⏱️ Speed: Slowest (baseline)
💾 Memory: Lowest
🎯 Best for: Educational purposes

2. SB (2016) - Sidetrack-Based

⏱️ Speed: Fast (2-3x faster than Yen)
💾 Memory: High
🎯 Best for: Balanced performance

3. SB* (2020)

⏱️ Speed: Fastest ⭐ (1.5-2x faster than SB)
💾 Memory: High (same as SB)
🎯 Best for: Time-critical applications

4. PSB (2020) - Parsimonious

⚙️ CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
Dataset Selection (line 38)
pythonGRAPH_FILES = {
    'small': 'USA-road-d.W.gr',
    'medium': 'USA-road-d.NY.gr',
    'large': 'USA-road-d.BAY.gr'
}
Experiment Parameters (line 41)
pythonEXPERIMENTS = [
    {'name': 'Experiment 1', 'k': 3, 'source': 1, 'target': 50},
    {'name': 'Experiment 2', 'k': 5, 'source': 1, 'target': 50},
    {'name': 'Experiment 3', 'k': 10, 'source': 1, 'target': 50}
]
Adjustable:

k: Number of shortest paths (try: 3, 5, 10, 50, 100)
source: Starting node
target: Destination node

Algorithm Selection (line 48)
pythonENABLE_ALGORITHMS = {
    'Yen': True,
    'SB': True,
    'SB*': True,
    'PSB': True
}
Set to False to skip an algorithm.
📈 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE
Small Graph (W - Washington):

Nodes: ~435K, Arcs: ~1M
k=10: ~2-10 seconds per algorithm
Memory: Low (fits in Colab free tier)

Medium Graph (NY - New York):

Nodes: ~264K, Arcs: ~733K
k=10: ~1-5 seconds per algorithm
Memory: Moderate

Large Graph (BAY - Bay Area):

Nodes: ~321K, Arcs: ~800K
k=10: ~2-8 seconds per algorithm
Memory: Moderate-High

Note: Actual times depend on source/target connectivity
⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING
Problem: "Directory not found"
Solution: Update DATA_DIR (line 36)
python# Try these alternatives:
"/content/drive/My Drive/graphs"  # Note: space in "My Drive"
"/content/drive/MyDrive/Graphs"   # Capital G
Problem: "Out of memory"
Solution:

Use smaller k values (3, 5, 10)
Use smaller graph (W instead of COL)
Disable some algorithms
Colab: Runtime > Change runtime type > High-RAM

Problem: "No path exists"
Solution:

Source/target not connected
Try different nodes: source=1, target=100

Problem: Slow execution
Solution:

Normal for large k (>50) on large graphs
Disable Yen algorithm (slowest)
Use smaller dataset

💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS
🎯 For Testing:

Start with k=3 on small graph (W)
Verify all algorithms produce same path lengths
Then scale up to larger k and graphs

📊 For Report:

Run experiments for k=3, 5, 10
Screenshot/save all tables immediately
Right-click charts → Save as image
Copy table text to Excel for formatting

⏱️ For Timing:

Each full run: 5-15 minutes
Test run (k=3, one graph): 1-2 minutes
Full report data (3 graphs, 3 k values): 15-30 minutes

💾 For Memory Management:

Restart Colab runtime between full runs
Don't run multiple experiments simultaneously
Close other tabs to save RAM

📝 USING IN YOUR REPORT
Include These:
✅ Tables (Section: Results)
